# AdventureGame
I have made this game as an school exercise. Solution contains tests for most important game logic methods.
It uses three layered architecture but, some functionality from Game class needs to be moved to the GameController class.
The cohesion of methods can be also improved especialy in the Game class. Game works as desired.
